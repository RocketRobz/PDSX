Playstation BIOS pseudo-emulator for DS/DSi

Ever wanted to run PS1 on your DS or DSi, but can't, due to it's impossibility to emulate?    
Well no worries! I have made something that brings at least parts of the PS1 experience to the DS/DSi!

Introducing PDSX, the PS1 pseudo-emulator for the DS(i) that brings the PS1 BIOS to your DS(i)!

Remember! This cannot run games, so you're only limited to the BIOS.

Controls
* START: Start/Stop pseudo-emulation
* SELECT: Swap screens between top and bottom

FAQs
* Q: What's a pseudo-emulator?    
A: An app that gives the impression of it being an emulator, but actually isn't.    
In PDSX's case, it may look like it's emulating the BIOS of the PS1 on the DS or DSi console, but it's actually a near-faithful recreation of it, including the logo and menu screens (as you'll see in PDSX's source code).
